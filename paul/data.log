1 | Ah, this is greasy. I want to eat kimchee.
1 | Is Chae Yoon's coordinator in here?
1 | Excuse me, aren't you Chae Yoon's coordinator?
1 | Yes. Me?
1 | -Chae Yoon is done singing.
1 | This lady right next to me... everyone knows who she is right?
1 | She is my forever idol...she is my rival whom I can never win against, she is the one who always makes me happy, and she is my mother.
1 | Everyone should remember my mom as one of the greatest movie stars, but instead of becoming an actress, she wanted to become a singer just like me.
1 | When I was stressed and exhausted, she'd always sing me a song while having me on her lap.
1 | Today, I would like to share that moment with everyone.
1 | Watch out! Watch Out!
1 | You cannot work yourself out.
1 | You're not normal.
1 | In your head, there is still a bullet left.
1 | Didn't you hear it from the doctor...
1 | You're back, are you?
1 | I knew you would be.
1 | ...I knew you would.
1 | Go to Korea.
1 | I packed your airplane ticket, some clothes and enough money to last you till you die.
1 | Hurry up and go.
1 | It's this evening's flight.
1 | Jason is trying to kill you.
1 | That car a while ago was sent by Jason.
1 | He burned all the pictures we've taken together.
1 | I'm sorry that this is what I can do for you.
1 | You saved our lives, but I can only do this for you and I'm very sorry.
1 | If he kills me, then I'll die.
1 | Go to our country and die, Moonhyuk.
1 | Oh poison!
1 | You tasted this and died. Oh careless love!
1 | Why die and not a drop of poison left for me?
1 | Oh sword...
1 | My heart be the dagger's sheath.
1 | Let me to death!
1 | Lead me to Romeo.
1 | Let's have you come out as an entertainer.
1 | You might get nominated for an academic award. When did you come?
1 | I thought it would take about 30 minutes.
1 | Hey sister...
1 | I think it's time for you to come out to the world.
1 | Let's go to the studio.
1 | I'll be your manager.
1 | A customer came to buy a laundry machine and took a catalogue.
1 | Stop fooling around and do a great job!
1 | I'm going.
1 | How long will you keep suffering inside to be Yoon's coordinator?
1 | I think you have the potential to be great. I'm not saying just because I'm your sister.
1 | Well you might not be good as Kang Min Joo...but you...
1 | I know myself more than you.
1 | You do well.
1 | Do you know how hard it was for me to get you employed here with the help of Yoon.
1 | If you get fired...
1 | Yoon?
1 | Okay. I'll be there soon.
1 | What did Yoon do now?
1 | Seriously there's not a day where you can just relax.
1 | I'm going to go. See you at home. - Okay, go.
1 | I also had an accident.
1 | They told me to work only today and not come back from tomorrow.
1 | My swearing boss said.
1 | He's handsome.
1 | If he were rich, how great that would be.
1 | Ah, he's handsome.
1 | Cha Moonhyuk, it is true that you were adopted right?
1 | Yes.
1 | You must not have memories of your mother or the country Korea.
1 | I don't remember anything.
1 | I hope everyone forgives cha moonhyuk's speaking.
1 | He didn't learn the proper speaking of Korean
1 | I hope everyone understands him. Yes, let's bring Cha Moonhyuk on stage.
1 | to find your family, is there any special things you can do or have anything that was given to you before you were adopted.
1 | We're on live right now.
1 | This must be a remembered necklace.
1 | So is this what you had when you were adopted?
1 | When and how did you get it?
1 | -Don't know.
1 | Can you please show it in front of the camera.
1 | That necklace is pretty. Where did I see that.
1 | It doesn't seem like a necklace from here.
1 | Can you get out and ask the lady where she got that necklace?
1 | Can you ask?
1 | Yes, yes ma'am.
1 | Is that platinum or silver?
1 | Put it back on!
1 | We have to keep watching so we can find you're family.
1 | No... I'm going to watch 'Janggoo'. Wait a second.
1 | I'm going to watch 'janggoo'.!
1 | After reading this, he disappeared during the rehearsal.
1 | A woman is is the way... (he misreads)
1 | To a woman... haht..hah'....
1 | You're dumb, how can you not know how to read korean?
1 | Hey, where are you hitting my child?
1 | What a strange man.
1 | Are you okay? Oh, saeng ni eh sae.
1 | I love you. The only thing I love is you.
1 | You know right?
1 | What the heck is that?
1 | Go and see.
1 | We're in the middle of shooting can you please be quiet?
1 | Please help us.
1 | Sorry.
1 | what kind of person is this!
1 | HEY!
1 | Can't you see we're shooting?
1 | Sorry! I'll try to solve the problem.
1 | Open the door!
1 | Yoon, please don't do this.
1 | Please,
1 | Please don't do this.
1 | What are you going to do if reporters see this. I don't get it.
1 | I seriously don't understand that girl.
1 | "Am I your servant?"
1 | Studio?
1 | Chae Moonhyuk.
1 | Nice to meet you.
1 | Let's go.
1 | No, I want to drink this.
1 | -Mom, you order that one.
1 | I ordered the Coke No, I orderd the cola.
1 | -After watching the show, that little boy gave us a call..
1 | He told us that his mother has the same exact looking necklace as yours.
1 | It's mine!
1 | It's because my mom had an accident along time ago.
1 | At age seven, a grandpa told me that she got hit by a trunk infront of a church and hurt her head.
1 | This... read it.
1 | Read what's incribed in your ring.
1 | Don't know.
1 | Can't your mother read?
1 | Is your mom stupid to read words?
1 | -She's not stupid.
1 | If she can't read, how is she not stupid?
1 | It's because she hasn't learned all the alphabet. She can read up to gah, nah, dah, lah, mah, bah, sah.
1 | Read what's written.
1 | For-ev-er...? Forever?
1 | You can't read words too? There are some words I can, and some words I can't.
1 | I'm not stupid.
1 | Compare to your mom, I'm a 1000 times smarter!
1 | Forver... together...
1 | You do you know me?
1 | Who are you?
1 | Suh Kyung.
1 | Yoon Suh Kyung.
1 | Eunchae, let's go home and make and eat spicy rice cake. Ok...
1 | I'm going to forget.
1 | Minjoo
1 | From this time, I'll completely forget her.
1 | Without any dusk, I'm going to completely erase her.
1 | Bye Kang Min Joo. It's goodbye forever!
1 | Don't lie.
1 | Grab a taxi and go home. I want to say something to Minjoo.
1 | I'll say something and go.
1 | So you go home first.
1 | You have money for taxi, right?
1 | I do.
1 | I'm drinking soju and I'll come back.
1 | I'll take a shot, come back, and do something about Minjoo
1 | I'll tell her not to make you sad and grab her hair and shake.
1 | I'll break her legs so that she can't meet anyone.
1 | Yah, it's time for her to get beaten up.
1 | Wait a second, I'll be back.
1 | -Don't lay a hand on her.
1 | It's not Minjoo's fault
1 | She's already warned me first.
1 | I'm the crazy one.
1 | I'll wait. Finish him off and come back.
1 | It's also find if you come without finishing him.
1 | I'll finish it off for you.
1 | You probably have to wait along time.
1 | I started to date him just a week ago.
1 | I can wait. A month is enough right? - Chae Yoon.
1 | You bastard!
1 | Why hit him?
1 | Together... Forever
1 | There's not a day when a grown up girl's face isn't ruined.
1 | It's scary to see a scab fall off!
1 | I'm alright, it doesn't hurt.
1 | Say you're alright one more time, I'm leaving you on the streets!
1 | I say that I'm alright because I'm alright, and it doesn't hurt because it doesn't hurt.
1 | Being alright?
1 | Not hurt?
1 | Are you made of metal?
1 | Are you a robot?
1 | Why'd you come out from there?
1 | Are you 119?
1 | (Police #)
1 | It really doesn't hurt.
1 | Get out.
1 | Fine, it hurts.
1 | It hurts so much I can die. I'm not alright.
1 | I'll never be alright.
1 | Not even after I die. How sad.
1 | So much I can die.
1 | What can we do...
1 | Chae Moonhyuk and Yoon Suh Kyung, I went to the orphanage you guys went to.
1 | You two were twins.
1 | Tw-ins?
1 | The necklace was on you two the whole time.
1 | That's all I know.
1 | Buy wrapped rice.
1 | Buy wrapped rice.
1 | -One please!
1 | Wrapped rice!
1 | How much? -Two dollars. Give me one.
1 | -Yes.
1 | Sir, this is a dollar.
1 | Give me two.
1 | Why do you always cheat?
1 | What do you mean cheat?
1 | You always cheat.
1 | Why do you take my customers?
1 | Your customer, my customer...they're not the same.
1 | Yours are yours, mine are mine.
1 | And that's that.
1 | That's not right!
1 | Buy these, buy these. I'll give them to you half price.
1 | Why is your mom sleeping that way?
1 | It's because she wraps rice at night.
1 | I'll give you all these for 300 dollars. I mean 200 dollars.
1 | Ok, I did. I cheated.
1 | If you cheat on the boy again,
1 | I won't leave you alone.
1 | Sukchae hurry and wake up.
1 | The sun is up your butt hole you guys!
1 | Wake up!
1 | I thought it was settled for a while.
1 | How did your eye become a black eye?
1 | I fell while I was walking.
1 | It's going to be alright after two days. It's ok.
1 | Instead of being Yoon's coordinator, you following with gangsters?
1 | Samchae's mom! -She's in the room.
1 | You going to the groceries?
1 | -I'm going. Why are you wearing sunglasses inside the room?
1 | You do ssangkapeul surgery?
1 | Hurry and come out.
1 | I have to take ma'am to the studio shortly.
1 | After I earn a lot of money, I'm moving out of this house just to avoid hearing about her.
1 | I'm going grocery shopping with dad, so go up and peal onions.
1 | Am I getting pregnant.
1 | I can't smell onions. Are there people coming to Yoon's house?
1 | Yoon's mother.
1 | She's getting ready for "self camera"
1 | She's putting on a show off her famous son.
1 | How arrogant.
1 | Stop with the bad remarks.
1 | Mom, you get botox?
1 | Okay..mom the camera is rolling. Don't get nervous...okay, 1, 2...
1 | Just like this, drinking coffee with my son is my joy and life.
1 | Ah, let's record again. I seriously think this lipstick doesn't fit me well.
1 | Why? It's pretty.
1 | Hello, I'm Chae Yoon.
1 | I heard my mom was doing a self camera, so...
1 | I'm just cutting in a little.
1 | Mom, can I say something to you? What? Say it.
1 | Say it...
1 | Mother, go over there and sit.
1 | You see,
1 | When I think about my mother, I'm really thankful and shed tears. Having me born to this world,
1 | Raising me up so perfectly,
1 | And always giving me so much love.
1 | Mom, you are my sunshine and idol.
1 | You know that right?
1 | I love you, mom.
1 | I love you
1 | You're not supposed to act like that to an adult.
1 | That lady is also a sad lady.
1 | Later on, tell her that you're sorry.
1 | Say that you're sorry, okay?
1 | Mister, are you a gangster?
1 | -Yes. What is your name?
1 | -Galshi. (Fish) The same Galchi you cook with.
1 | Is that your name? -Yes.
1 | What grade are you in?
1 | -I don't go to school.
1 | Even though I don't go to school, I can read korean.
1 | Speak a little english.
1 | I'm pretty smart.
1 | -What about your father?
1 | I don't have those.
1 | Hey grandpa!
1 | -Oh hey. Let's each Samkyupsal. This is the guy I met.
1 | The guy who has the necklace.
1 | The guy who is from Australia.
1 | Your eyes take after your mom's eyes, a lot.
1 | Quite similar.
1 | Have you ate samkyupsal before?
1 | How about soju?
1 | I'm sorry.
1 | I'm sorry, Eunchae
1 | If no guys come to you because your face is full of injuries...
1 | And if they don't like you, and no one takes you,
1 | Then just come to me. I'll live with you. Come to me.
1 | For real, I'll take care of you.
1 | What's wrong? Water!
1 | What's wrong, Song Eun-chae?
1 | Why aren't you picking it up?
1 | It's Minjoo.
1 | How do I look?
1 | Am I pretty? You're pretty.
1 | How about you, Eunchae? Am I pretty?
1 | Yes, you're beautiful. What kind of earring will match with this kind of clothes?
1 | Diamond? Ruby? Saphire?
1 | It's better than bacon right?
1 | It's because you have korean taste. Do you... know my mother?
1 | Does she live in this neighborhood?
1 | My mother? -No... Why would you mom live in a crappy neighborhood like this?
1 | ...very smart.
1 | My mother...
1 | Help me meet her. I'll let you meet her.
1 | It's time for you to meet her.
1 | You.. are all quite smart.
1 | How'd you learn the language so well? You said this was better than bacon, so eat.
1 | I don't really like this necklace.
1 | Thiis necklace and this dress don't match, right?
1 | They are pretty, why?
1 | Fake stuff is obvious.
1 | Wouldn't the dress look fake too?
1 | Didn't you buy that necklace very expensive? - Not expensive.
1 | 1000 dollars.
1 | A thousand...
1 | Is as much as my daughter's tuition.
1 | Just wear it.
1 | You look quite glamorous, so it's okay.
1 | Is that so?
1 | Let's leave, ma'am.
1 | To get to the studio, we're already late. Let's go.
1 | Are you a stalker?
1 | Mom, Sook-chae is trying to hit me.
1 | Hurry and raise your hands!
1 | Nobody does these kind of things anymore.
1 | Look at my age.
1 | How old are you?
1 | A 28 (?
1 | ) yo with nothing better things to do so she steals a guy's clothing.
1 | -Like I said.
1 | If Yoon's mom finds out, we'll all get kicked out of this house!
1 | Yoon is a star...a star!
1 | And these...these are not Yoon's.
1 | These can be considered to be from Yoon's fans.
1 | How much is this?
1 | How much do you get exactly? -You gonna buy it?
1 | Each one is 30 dollars... with a discount I can give it to you for 150 dollars.
1 | What the...just those are 30 dollars each?
1 | The hankercheif Yoon used to wipe his sweat at his concert.
1 | That sold for 50 dollars.
1 | 50 dollars?
1 | -They put these in auctions.
1 | Things used by Elvis Presley...
1 | those are worth big money!
1 | Unbelievable...
1 | At the house...there are many hankerchiefs Yoon's used to wipe his face and sweat.
1 | Then...we shouldn't washed them, right?
1 | -Exactly. So bring them to me.
1 | So bring that and I'll cut you in.
1 | How much would bowls and dishes sell for?
1 | If we consider some things...
1 | About 1000 dollars.
1 | Call the police, Minchae!
1 | Tell them to take these two away.
1 | Song Eun Chae! - Are you calling?
1 | I finished him off. Sooner than you expected, huh?
1 | You've become so pale.
1 | Aren't you going to take me? You taking me?
1 | Sorry... for confusing you.
1 | I'm making...
1 | Chachang ramen. You want some?
1 | Who it it?
1 | Let me use the restroom.
1 | But who is it?
1 | restroom.
1 | This isn't a public restroom.
1 | I'm going to piss my pants.
1 | Let me use it! -Piss yourself.
1 | Am I stopping you?
1 | What a psycho!
1 | Sis!
1 | What's the problem?
1 | What's wrong that is making your face fired up?
1 | Did you fart in front of Yoon? Hurry up and stop farting!
1 | I need to pee too!
1 | -Go to Yoon's.
1 | What should I do, Minchae?
1 | -Are you constipated too?
1 | There is a guy who came from Australia to see me.
1 | I met him when I followed Yoon to shoot his CF.
1 | I got helped a lot.
1 | -You have a boyfriend?
1 | Not me, just that person.
1 | Not you, him?
1 | -Yeah. It seems he's fallen for me.
1 | I feel so sorry, what I should I do?
1 | He's fallen for you...so you're saying he's come all the way from Australia for you.
1 | Did you sleep with him?
1 | Did you?
1 | Yes.
1 | I was freezing to death so we held each other. I think that's when he started to fall for me.
1 | You must be crazy!
1 | -That's what I'm sayin.
1 | How could you? The world's gonna end.
1 | No.
1 | It's not that.
1 | Oh, how disgusting.
1 | For how long have you guys been in here?
1 | Sookchae, aren't you done?
1 | Eunchae, Minchae...aren't you done washing up?
1 | -We are done.
1 | We'll be out soon.
1 | Then come out.
1 | Your father has to use the bathroom too!
1 | Mom! -What?
1 | Eunchae said she slept with a guy.
1 | We must prepare a gift.
1 | No!
1 | We did sleep but not in that way!
1 | I haven't even kissed with a guy.
1 | Now I'm seeing things. I feel so sorry.
1 | -Going somewhere?
1 | To see my brother. -Brother?
1 | Oh good...eat this.
1 | -What is this?
1 | Mountain Ginseng.
1 | Added some honey on the mountain ginseng or something like that.
1 | Eat it. How can I eat this fragile thing?
1 | -Because it is, you should eat it.
1 | I don't want to.
1 | Your mother bought it for you.
1 | Hey, I can't eat this.
1 | How could I?
1 | You eat it.
1 | Then I'm throwing it away.
1 | My mouth is my mouth. Is your mouth dirty then?
1 | Yoon...
1 | Give it so I can give it to a dog.
1 | -Hey, Ok!
1 | I'll eat it.
1 | Ok now? -Yes.
1 | My mom says she feels great when feeding me delicious food.
1 | I feel great when I do the same for you.
1 | Probably in the past, I might have been your mom or dad.
1 | Eat well and grow a lot, ok?
1 | -Son! Yes? -Yoon, put this on and go.
1 | What is that?
1 | -This is milk oil.
1 | It's great for dark circles.
1 | -Who has dark circles?
1 | So we have to prepare for it beforehand.
1 | I feel like dying when I see your handsome face get dirty.
1 | Eunchae, so what happened with that guy?
1 | Guy? -Sure.
1 | Eunchae's got a boyfriend. She has a boyfriend?
1 | Eunchae?
1 | Who is it? What does he do? -He must be sensitive.
1 | He was even crying.
1 | Eunchae, do a good job.
1 | If you make someone else cry,
1 | Then your eyes will cry blood.
1 | Good luck, Eunchae.
1 | Congratulations, you wicked girl!
1 | Eunchae has no sense for understanding guys.
1 | Why am I feeling upset?
1 | Get in!
1 | I had a cramp.
1 | I almost died.
1 | You can't reveal your fear to God...
1 | You have to crush it first.
1 | That's the only way you make friends with him
1 | When'd you learn how to swim?
1 | I didn't learn.
1 | You weren't taught?
1 | But I haven't learned either.
1 | Then what do I do to become as good as you?
1 | Try your best!
1 | -Then I guess I should come here more often.
1 | But I don't swim!
1 | When I think of my mother,
1 | I feel grateful and I start to cry,
1 | She gave birth to me, and raised me well.
1 | And giving me so much love.
1 | Mom, you are my sunshine and idol.
1 | How is it?
1 | But this place... it seems...
1 | Look over here.
1 | Stripes look great on Yoon.
1 | This is the fifth, ma'am.
1 | -Oh yeah?
1 | This style wouldn't work on anyone but Yoon, right?
1 | But, ma'am, this please is extremely expensive.
1 | Red is great on my son as well.
1 | One second...
1 | Having a great son it hard work too, sis.
1 | Yes,
1 | Yoon? You can't reach him?
1 | He said he was going to meet up with his "brother".
1 | I don't know what he was talking about.
1 | Newspapers? No, I didn't see them.
1 | What? "Kang Minjoo's fling with Chae Yoon"
1 | "Kang Minjoo reveals all:
1 | Love's a just a game to me, I was only playing"
1 | I have to go somewhere.
1 | I'll see you later.
1 | To drive like that?
1 | Would your head crack like that?
1 | Want a hammer? Today I'm gonna die.
1 | And so will she.
1 | No one better stop me.
1 | Come in, Eunchae! Door's open!
1 | Wait, just one more round... Isn't this too much?
1 | Go explain yourself to Yoon.
1 | It seems the interview is out...
1 | You wanna die?
1 | You wanna get beat? You have any idea how much Yoon loved you?
1 | Yoon, the guy you cheated on.
1 | But I can't change who I am.
1 | You know I'm a flirt by nature.
1 | Why do you live this way?
1 | Is this the way you want to live?
1 | Why do you live so recklessly?
1 | Want to end your career? Are you a rock head?
1 | Are you an idiot?
1 | Have you decided to end it all?
1 | You idiot, you dummy, you moron!
1 | You done hitting me?
1 | Is that all the power you got?
1 | At least you should break a rib or something.
1 | Yoon... I think I like him.
1 | I think because of that...
1 | Maybe because I was really starting to like him...
1 | That's why I did it. What?
1 | You like Yoon, don't you?
1 | I'm a romance scholar.
1 | You think I wouldn't know?
1 | I knew since a long time ago. Who's heard of a friendship between a guy and girl?
1 | What is this girl talking about?
1 | Do you really want to be beat today?
1 | Still
1 | I wanted to go all the way, but I couldn't because of you.
1 | You have him. You can have him.
1 | That's right.
1 | You should be beat!
1 | You need a beating to get you back to your senses.
1 | I'm going to beat you to a pulp!
1 | You're dead, Kang Minjoo!
1 | Can't you stop that, Eunchae?
1 | What gives you the right to hit her?
1 | No one lays a finger on her!
1 | Yoon!
1 | Mind your business from now on.
1 | Don't meddle in ours, Eunchae.
1 | Don't overreact.
1 | You got it?
1 | Go out!
1 | Didn't you hear me?
1 | Get the hell out!
1 | I'm still owe you one.
1 | Don't get hit again,
1 | ..from me or Eunchae.
1 | If someone does this again,
1 | I'm going to kill em.
1 | Be it Eunchae, or me.
1 | I'll kill them all.
1 | Don't do that again.
1 | You'll die too.
1 | And I'll die.
1 | I'm sorry.
1 | I won't be that way again. I'm sorry.
1 | Poor baby.
1 | Are you lost?
1 | Don't cry. Don't cry, ok?
1 | I'll find your mother for you.
1 | Crying is bad.
1 | Santa Clause doesn't give presents to children who cry.
1 | So don't cry.
1 | Hello? This is Perry's mother, right?
1 | Hi, I'm Song Eunchae...
1 | What's the capitol of Australia?
1 | Don't you even know the capital of your own country?
1 | Canberra. Isn't it Sydney?
1 | -Canberra.
1 | Was it changed?
1 | What about our country?
1 | Seoul.
1 | So you're not demented.
1 | Then ok. Let's go out.
1 | Are you embarrassed?
1 | Is looking at my face difficult for you?
1 | You're introverted, I see.
1 | I didn't think so.
1 | Try some of mine. This is what couples do when they go out.
1 | It's called being affectionate.
1 | You're ashamed. You're so cute.
1 | -Please be quiet.
1 | I'll be asleep for 5 minutes, so please.. be quiet.
1 | Are you ok?
1 | Hey! Wake up!
1 | Get it together!
1 | Have some. -It's ok.
1 | You eat it.
1 | Eat!
1 | -I don't eat eaten food.
1 | But Eunchae does.
1 | She has the stomach for that.
1 | Am I a stranger?
1 | -Sorry.
1 | That's my personality.
1 | I don't eat from my mother's leftovers either.
1 | -Bathroom.
1 | Do you get home safe, Eunchae?
1 | About before...
1 | I was out of line.
1 | You're not upset, are you?
1 | Actually, I didn't mean to offend you.
1 | Why isn't she saying anything?
1 | Hello?
1 | Isn't this Song Eunchae's cell phone?
1 | -The owner has fainted.
1 | Her dad says he's coming now.
1 | Where is over there?
1 | Sir, sir!
1 | Please wake up.
1 | Are you ok?
1 | They won't even budge.
1 | Pardon me!
1 | Excuse me.
1 | They fainted while kissing.
1 | Eunchae!
1 | She's like this when she's drunk.
1 | I can't pull them apart.
1 | What happened?
1 | These two... were drinking and then they kissed and...
1 | Get it together!
1 | Help me lift her.
1 | What happened?
1 | How did Moohyuk and Eunchae end up together?
1 | Is he someone you know?
1 | -How do you know him?
1 | He's just a guy I like.
1 | What does he do?
1 | I'm not sure either.
1 | Yoon! -Yes?
1 | What exactly does Eunchae like?
1 | Chicken, rice...
1 | -What doesn't she like?
1 | Ghosts, orangutans, hospitals..
1 | Why do you ask?
1 | Because I'm her father...
1 | Yet I don't know a lot about her.
1 | You've spent more time with her than me, right?
1 | You'll probably know her more than I do. Right?
1 | Is Eunchae...
1 | Is Eunchae promiscuous?
1 | What?
1 | Let go.
1 | You're so strange.
1 | Just leave it. I'll fold it up later.
1 | What? Did you piss the bed?
1 | What secret is this now?
1 | I'm late for school.
1 | Yesterday, who brought me home?
1 | -Dad did.
1 | Mom's having a fit because of you so run like hell when you see her.
1 | You... would you look at my lips...
1 | What about them? How is it?
1 | Does it look they've been kissed?
1 | I'm not sure if it was a dream or not...
1 | It doesn't seem like it was a dream...
1 | Look at them.
1 | Do they look like they've been kissed?
1 | What do kissed lips look like anyway?
1 | -I wouldn't know.
1 | Since I never kissed anyone.
1 | -What did you do yesterday?
1 | Well, exactly....
1 | But you've read a lot of weird books, so wouldn't you know?
1 | I wouldn't know either...
1 | Your lips seem bruised and swollen.
1 | In my estimation, you were kissed.
1 | They say the body remembers what your brain doesn't.
1 | Kiss that guy again.
1 | What?
1 | Kiss. -You crazy? Whatever.
1 | Forget it! Sister!
1 | I'm not liking these dishes.
1 | Where might the Italian china be?
1 | Don't move a step!
1 | Who are you?
1 | -You're hurt, stay still!
1 | Aren't you Eunchae's boyfriend?
1 | But why are you here?
1 | Where's the medicine?
1 | Yoon!
1 | Where's the medicine! Son!
1 | Yoon is asleep!
1 | Where's the medicine!
1 | What's going on?
1 | Who is that man? -Who?
1 | Ah, that's Moohyuk. -Why is he at our house.
1 | I brought him over last night.
1 | He was too drunk. -I told you not to bring just anyone in!
1 | But he was drunk and we didn't where he lives.
1 | You don't even know where he lives, you don't even know him well.
1 | Why bring him here?
1 | Are you common man?
1 | You're in show business.
1 | Quiet. He'll hear us.
1 | -Who do you take after that you can act this way?
1 | Since you're my mother, probably after you.
1 | I got to take a leak, I'll be back.
1 | That guy scares me.
1 | Tell him to leave, please.
1 | -What's scary about him?
1 | He won't eat you.
1 | I'm going to wash, so just stay around.
1 | Hey!
1 | Then I'll go with you to the bathroom.
1 | Were you hurt?
1 | -Yeah, I was hurt a lot, I'm bleeding.
1 | I can't live. ... Put some medicine on it.
1 | Let me borrow this for a while.
1 | Am I a joke to you?
1 | If you show up again... and you're dead!
1 | Will she be ok?
1 | -She'll be fine. It was a good thing to stop her bleeding.
1 | Buy some kimbop!
1 | Buy some dukkbogi!
1 | Have you sold a lot?
1 | It's blood!
1 | You should go the hospital.
1 | Why... did you tell me?
1 | My mother...
1 | What would I do about it?
1 | What would I do about it, old man!
1 | Do whatever you want.
1 | Whatever you want. All done.
1 | Go to the hospital. My mother...
1 | That lady...
1 | Did she wrong you too?
1 | Yes. Galchi, let's have dinner together tonight.
1 | Let's make jorim.
1 | Kang Minjoo has avowed her relationship with Chae Yoon today.
1 | I've worked hard the past 3 years
1 | With her alone
1 | I can give up everything else in the world.
1 | Without her,
1 | I don't feel alive.
1 | What are your feelings toward Chae Yoon?
1 | Chae Yoon is the nicest and most honest man I know.
1 | I've done him a lot of wrong,
1 | But I'm determined to make it up to him.
1 | I didn't think love was real, But through Yoon, I've come to believe.
1 | He's scary, just tell him to leave.
1 | Do whatever you want.
1 | Both of them have opened their hearts and the public agrees they match well.
1 | They're rising in popularity.
1 | Due to today's conference, the issue is getting hot.
1 | Live happily, Yoon!
1 | If you hurt him, I won't leave you alone, Minjoo!
1 | Be happy together!
1 | Who are you?
1 | Can't you recognize your mother and sister?
1 | Why are you guys staring at me?
1 | Is there something on my face? -There is.
1 | No joking, lots of stuff on your face.
1 | Ah alright, alright!
1 | I already made a promise.
1 | Today at five, at the Seoul Hotel first floor coffee shop... a guy...
1 | About 26 yo...
1 | Your "date"...
1 | (for marriage)
1 | I'm set up for a "marriage interview", mom?
1 | Alright alright.
1 | If this date gets cancelled, I'm going to dig a hole and bury myself.
1 | -It's not a threat.
1 | Mom looked at a coffin a while ago.
1 | I looked at a blackish copper coffin.
1 | -Give it up, mom.
1 | If Eunchae goes on this date then I'll immediately go into Seoul University.
1 | Well yeah.
1 | If Eunchae goes... then I'll give you this bed, mom.
1 | Yah yah...
1 | If she goes on this date ...you be the mother.
1 | I'll go on the date.
1 | With news as good as that, you should have told me sooner.
1 | If that person is wonderful, can I propose to him first, mom?
1 | Do you not like me?
1 | It's not that I don't like you.
1 | You're just not my type.
1 | What is your type?
1 | It's hard for me to say... Do you want to draw your type then?
1 | Ten minutes haven't even passed.
1 | How can you tell if I'm your type or not?
1 | If you look at me close enough...
1 | I might be your type. - I can tell in one minute.
1 | How do you figure that in a minute, huh?
1 | Nonsense. - I can. It doesn't make sense.
1 | Tell me the truth. What exactly don't you like about me?
1 | How can I... .. tell you that?
1 | Tell me. It's alright.
1 | Since you're asking...
1 | I really don't like your appearance.
1 | What about my appearance?
1 | Take a look in the mirror.
1 | I have to get to the broadcast station fast so I don't think I can take you home.
1 | That's why I brought my car too. I'll call you.
1 | How can I help you?
1 | Hey! -Lady!
1 | Lady?
1 | - You...
1 | Where do you put your eyes when driving?
1 | Look here, guy. - Lady, my baby is..
1 | Take your car out now.
1 | Didn't you hear me?
1 | -I didn't know.
1 | When I was parking, I didn't feel a thing.
1 | I didn't know.
1 | Take the car out.
1 | I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'll pay you.
1 | If this isn't enough, leave me with your number. You know who I am right?
1 | I'm Kang Minj...
1 | What is this?
1 | What do you think you're doing?
1 | Are you trying to toy with me?
1 | But, you picked the wrong person, man.
1 | I'm Kang Minjoo!
1 | Shut your mouth and pull your car out. Leave my site by one minute, lady!
1 | Chae Yoon! -Oh hyung,
1 | Where were you? -Where are you? Broadcasting station.
1 | Wanna come over?
1 | Am I officially your manager from today?
1 | -Yeah, the official work starts from tomorrow.
1 | Wait for ten minutes. I just got in a taxi...
1 | What a sad doggy dog.
1 | So you're not crazy. Fine then.
1 | Let's date.
1 | Do I look like a pushover to you?
1 | You, if you appear before me again...
1 | Why is that sound coming all the way through here.
1 | Sangchae, wake up!
1 | There is a picture shoot today, right?
1 | Yoon.
1 | Son.
1 | Wake up and wash and then let's get to the picture shoot.
1 | Not waking up?
1 | Get up, get up!
1 | Go out with your son, why don't you?
1 | Disgusting!
1 | I may have given birth to you but you guys are pathetic!
1 | Today...
1 | Fire!
1 | Fire! Sonchae!
1 | Fire!
1 | Stop playing!
1 | Are you up?
1 | For a while now. Then why pretend to be asleep?
1 | Just because.
1 | I didn't want to open my eyes so I just lazily stayed put.
1 | Yoon and his mother Today there going to have a photo shoot.
1 | Are you sick?
1 | Look at the sweat.
1 | You even have a fever!
1 | I'm a little sick I guess.
1 | Do you think you can go? I mean, what's going on with you? It's ok.
1 | I'll be fine.
1 | Hello doggy dog.
1 | Sleep well?
1 | Did you sleep well?
1 | -Yes. Good morning.
1 | Wake up Yoon.
1 | I can't do a thing to wake him up.
1 | -He's still sleeping?
1 | Yeah, he went to sleep at dawn. He said he dreamed of a ghost.
1 | He even came into my room and slept with me.
1 | Don't tell Minjoo about Yoon being this way.
1 | - Being what way?
1 | Like not being able to sleep after a scary dream, like how he's afraid of ghosts at his age.
1 | Sure.
1 | Yoon, wake up!
1 | You have a shoot to go to.
1 | Wake up, it's late.
1 | People are waiting for you.
1 | Are you going to cancel?
1 | I'm going to cancel.
1 | Wake up. Oh, good boy! I'm not good!
1 | You know about the Kong Kong Ghost right?
1 | The ghost who died falling down from a three story building?
1 | The ghost who walks on its head like... kong kong kong.
1 | The kong kong ghost is searching for the person who pushed her to her death.
1 | Pusher's name is Chae Yoon.
1 | Kong kong kong.
1 | Just now, it opens the door and enters.
1 | Kong kong kong.
1 | It's gotten into the living room...
1 | Kong kong kong.
1 | It crawls up the stairs... Has it reached Yoon's room?
1 | He's not in here...
1 | Kong kong kong.
1 | Then after that, it goes back downstairs...
1 | Kong kong kong.
1 | Finds out that Yoon is in his mom's room.
1 | There is something laying down by your side.
1 | Why don't you get off of me and go. Get off.
1 | -Don't want to.
1 | Hey, am I your wife?
1 | Am I your mother? It feels gross.
1 | What did you just say?
1 | I'm gross? Yes, you are.
1 | That makes me depressed, Eunchae!
1 | Really depressed. I'm not going to the shoot today.
1 | -Go or don't go. Is she on drugs?
1 | I should emigrate.
1 | Am I really that sick?
1 | Concentrate, Eunchae!
1 | Concentrate.
1 | Why did you poke me?
1 | Hey, it is you.
1 | -Why poke me?
1 | I thought I was hallucinating...
1 | and wanted to check...
1 | Do you like me too?
1 | -No! They why poke a man standing still?
1 | You do you like me, right?
1 | So that's why you poked me? No!
1 | Your face isn't looking well.
1 | You sick somewhere? -No.
1 | You look sick.
1 | - No.
1 | Your face is pale.
1 | Is no the only thing you can say?
1 | - No. You hate me? -No...
1 | Am I a joke to you?
1 | Do I look like a pushover?
1 | If you show up even once more ... then you'll really be dead!
1 | I warned you, didn't I?
1 | That if you showed up again, I'd kill you?
1 | I do what I say.
1 | If I say I'll kill you, I do it.
1 | Kill me.
1 | You are crazy, huh? Yeah.
1 | -Are you schizo?
1 | Go. Just go.
1 | Go back to your country.
1 | Go back to Australia. Go, I said go.
1 | I don't like you.
1 | You're seriously not my type.
1 | I don't even like thinking about guys like you, so leave.
1 | Leave, please!
1 | What are you doing, Eunchae? Who are you to tell my bro to go or not?
1 | Sleep well?
1 | You sleep well too, bro?
1 | When'd you get here? - 1 hour.
1 | - I have a photo shoot with my mom today.
1 | Let's leave together when she comes out. Sure.
1 | This man... the new manager is this man?
1 | -That's right, why? Are you nuts?
1 | Are you crazy?
1 | How can you hire a dude like this?
1 | How can you talk like that? A dude like him?
1 | He's older than you are.
1 | And... Are you on drugs today?
1 | From this point on, I'm not you're coordinator.
1 | Hire someone else. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
1 | We're late because of me, right?
1 | Mom, Eunchae says she won't be my coordinator from today.
1 | -Don't know.
1 | She says I should hire someone else.
1 | -Why, Eunchae?
1 | Did Yoon do something wrong again? How could he hire anyone else?
1 | Except for you, no one can handle Yoon.
1 | It's not that.
1 | -Our Yoon...
1 | I'll scorn him later.
1 | Lets go right now, we're late.
1 | You?
1 | He's my manager since yesterday, mom. You know Moohyuk, right?
1 | It must be 'that day' for Eunchae.
1 | She's weird.
1 | She says I'm disgusting.
1 | And a while ago, she swore at Moohyuk.
1 | She's random, that girl.
1 | -She is a grown-up woman...don't call her girl.
1 | That person, Eunchae did you get him to work?
1 | No.
1 | No, ma'am.
1 | Isn't he your boyfriend, Eunchae?
1 | No, nothing like that.
1 | Later... if you ask me who I'd choose between Moohyuk and you,
1 | I'd choose Moohyuk!
1 | Got that!
1 | Why?
1 | Because Moohyuk is cool!
1 | He's not a snob like you.
1 | If anyone talks foul about him again,
1 | I won't leave that person alone, no matter who.
1 | Got it?
1 | If I'm a star, I'm a star.
1 | No, dirty and filthy... and disgusting right?
1 | You should at least say something.
1 | Yoon. -What?
1 | Let's break away with no hard feelings.
1 | It's our last day, so I want to end it nicely.
1 | Are you really going to quit?
